The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## To do

- note saved indicator
- realtime listener on notes
- delete note button
- help info alert
- adjust sidebar styling to have max width
- move firestore function calls to functions to allow for server side validation
- server side validation (in functions)
- client side validation
- add documentation for deploying functions and app
- split sidebar into multiple components for more efficient rendering
- last modified dates in sidebar should update every 5 seconds
- maybe use firestore filtering to return dates by date modified
- analyse build size to see what imports can be removed
